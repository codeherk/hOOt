## The code in this repository was written as a senior capstone project in Computer Science at Temple University during the Spring 2019 semester.


## The hooT system leverages the Canvas LMS API and a variety of Amazon services to provide a hands-free voice user interface for Alexa-enabled devices.


## hooT users may use the functions from the project's CLI package to make a variety of HTTP requests to the CANVAS LMS API from the command line.
